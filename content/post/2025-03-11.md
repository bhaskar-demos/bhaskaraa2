In a recent keynote address at the India Today Conclave 2025, Professor Bharat N. Anand, a distinguished educator from Harvard University, delved into the transformative potential of Artificial Intelligence (AI) in education. Anand, who oversees teaching and learning at Harvard, provided a comprehensive overview of how AI, particularly generative AI and large language models is reshaping educational institutions and classrooms.

# The Rise of AI in Education

## Accelerating Technology Adoption

**Bharat N. Anand** highlighted the accelerating pace of technology adoption, noting that while computers took 20 years to reach 30% penetration in the US economy, **smartphones achieved 70% penetration in just 7 years**. This acceleration emphasizes the urgency for educators to address AI's impact.

## AI's Transformative Potential

"The transformative potential of AI in education does not stem from its intelligence but from its **accessibility**," Anand asserted. The revolution lies in the interface, which has democratized technology through the evolution from punch cards to graphical user interfaces, making it accessible even to young children.

## Challenging Misconceptions

Anand challenged the misconception that we should wait for AI to become "smart enough" before classroom integration. He emphasized that **even with current limitations, AI offers significant cost and time savings**. He compared this to low-cost airlines like RyanAir, which succeed through cost efficiency rather than superior service.

## Practical Educational Applications

AI can be integrated into education through:
- Handling high-volume customer support
- Drafting legal agreements
- Assisting in creative tasks
- Automating mundane tasks like email responses
- Designing case studies
- Summarizing student questions during lectures

Anand referenced interviews with 35 Harvard faculty using AI in their classrooms, available by searching "generative AI faculty voices Harvard."

## Impact on Learning Outcomes

A Harvard study in the Physical Sciences 2 course revealed that **students using AI tutors showed higher mastery and engagement compared to those with human tutors**. However, Anand cautioned that AI might widen educational gaps, as those with domain expertise are more likely to benefit from AI tools.

## Strategic Considerations for Educators

Anand emphasized the need for strategic conversation about teachers' roles in the AI age. The true value of education lies in developing skills like logic, memory, and communication rather than specific content.

"When we think about what we learned in school, it's not the particular content but the way we were learning," Anand said. "The real purpose of case method was listening and communication. The real purpose of proofs was understanding logic."

## Approaches to AI Integration

### Expert vs. Entry-Level
- **Domain Specialists**: Can leverage AI to enhance existing knowledge and create personalized learning
- **Beginners**: Can utilize pre-built AI tools to automate basic tasks like grading

### Mindset Approaches
- **Lazy Mindset**: May rely on AI for quick answers, potentially missing deeper learning
- **Growth Mindset**: Views AI as a tool to augment learning, explore new ideas, and continuously improve

## Conclusion

Anand urged educators to focus on lifelong learning and intrinsic motivation. He advised parents to encourage children to develop skills robust to machine intelligence, such as creativity, judgment, and empathy.

"The kids know where this is going," Anand noted, emphasizing the importance of following inspiring teachers to build lasting skills like curiosity and intrinsic motivation that will serve students throughout their lives.
