I'm Bhaskar, and my journey in programming has been largely self-taught, guided by studying open-source projects and practical experience gained through various work assignments.

In these blog posts, I aim to share my learnings and experiences, hoping they might serve as useful insights for others.
Some of my posts might appear incomplete as they are essentially brief notes, reflecting my learning process and shaped by the reference materials I use, as well as the time I have available for documentation.

Most of the content I share is adapted from various sources, and I'll include references to the primary sources on each page.
All my learnings and observations are personal and not associated with my current or previous employers.

The information presented in these posts represents my own understanding and experiences.

They are not  recommendations or suggestions, and come with no warranty of any kind. Readers should use their own judgment when applying these concepts in their work.
