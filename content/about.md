I'm Bhaskar, and my journey in programming has been largely self-taught, guided
by studying open-source projects and practical experience gained through various
work assignments.

In these blog posts, I aim to share my learnings and experiences, hoping they
might serve as useful insights for others. Some of my posts might appear
incomplete as they are essentially brief notes, reflecting my learning process
and shaped by the reference materials I use, as well as the time I have
available for documentation.
